## Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The task of predicting who would survive the disaster based on various factors like 
socio-economic status, age, and gender is a classic problem in data science. This project is ideal for those looking to delve into classification models and understand 
the impact of different variables on survival rates.

## Task 2: STOCK PRICE PREDICTION WITH LSTM
Stock price prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing time series data to forecast future prices. This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks,
a type of deep learning model, to predict the future stock prices of a company based on its historical data. If you’re interested in applying deep learning to financial data, 
this project is a great way to get started.

## Task 3: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear regression is one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning and is widely used for predictive modeling. In this task, you’ll build a predictive model to estimate 
a numerical outcome, such as housing prices, based on multiple features. This project is perfect for learning how to apply linear regression to real-world data and 
interpret the results effectively.
